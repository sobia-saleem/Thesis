Step1: generate feature values for one problem transformation
Step2: organize values of individual features in seperate files using feature_recalc.m
step3: apply ANOVA test using anova_test.m code.
step4: apply Aova_value to get the percentage score for each feature.

The code feature_recalc.m generates files for individual features(12). 
Each file contains feature values (50 individual runs) calculated on one problem transformation.

The code for calculating feature values is copied from
